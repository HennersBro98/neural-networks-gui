Source code files can be found above.

To download and install:

 1.(Recommended) Follow this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s514dlfbqtqonoq/AACub-6b_FEfYOT0OCXnVyfDa?dl=0) to find an installer on dropbox to easily download the application.
 2. Download the source files to the same file path and execute henpy_NN_GUI.py. You may be required to download more Python packages if not all those which are required are installed on your device.
  
Note: Currently the costs plot feature is not working within the application. If this is something you require, it will work using installation method 2 above for now.

A very simple sample file of data is also provided to help illustrate how the software can be used.
