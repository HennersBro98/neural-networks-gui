# neural-networks-gui
***A user interface for working with neural networks***

Source code files can be found above.

To download and install:

1. (Recommended for Windows) Follow this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s514dlfbqtqonoq/AACub-6b_FEfYOT0OCXnVyfDa?dl=0) to find an installer on dropbox to easily download the application.
2. Download the source files (.py and .ico ones) to the same file path and execute henpy_NN_GUI.py. You may be required to download more Python packages if not all those which are required are installed on your device.

Note:

* The black console box will appear when the application is loading up, it may take a little longer to start first time it is run. This black console box will display errors and will let you know if the program is still computing.
* The costs plot feature may take a little longer to load on the first run of each start-up.
* I am soon to start university to learn more about ML, so will try to update it with further functionality. Also let me know if there are any other missing features which you would like!

A very simple sample file of data is also provided to help illustrate how the software can be used.

If you have found this free software useful or enjoyed using it, please consider making a non-obligatory donation to support me using this [PayPal link](https://www.paypal.me/HenryBroomfield1998). I will pledge 50% of all donations to [Alzheimer's Research UK](https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/), a cause which is striving to help understand and improve our own, internal neural networks. Try to leave an identifying note such as 'NNGUI', so that the charitable donation can be easily rerouted.
